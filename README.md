# Login_system

The goal of this project is to design a simple login/registration system with the ability to limit suspicious requests.
In the system in question, the goal is to implement a process similar to the current login/registration process
Implement the system based on RESTful API, in which case there is no need for a frontend, but in this case, the Postman Collection file is in there for test.
